### Props in detail

**numberOfKeys:**

12 colors have been set by default. In order to increase the `numberOfKeys` over 12, you need to create your own custom color scheme.

**colors:**

`colors` will use the last element to paint all remaining keys. For example,

```js
colors={[
  {
    color: 'pink',
    colorPressed: 'grey',
    background: 'salmon'
  },
  {
    color: 'teal'
  }
]}
```

only the first key will be pink, and the remaining will be teal.

This allows you to avoid duplication for colors that are the same for each key.

**pressedKey**:

`pressedKey` allows you to pass in a function which can be used to determine which key was pressed most recently.

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { pressedKey: 0 };
  this.setPressedKey = this.setPressedKey.bind(this);
}

...

<Xylophone
  pressedKey={this.setPressedKey}
/>

...

setPressedKey(key) {
  this.setState({pressedKey: key})
}
```

## Develop

All changes should be made within the `./components` folder.

After making changes, run `yarn build`. This command will compile the files to ES5, convert Sass to CSS, and update any Sass imports.

To test that your changes worked, install this project into a React app using `npm install path/to/this/folder` and render the `<Xylophone />` component.
